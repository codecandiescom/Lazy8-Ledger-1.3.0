<h1>
<font size=+4>Data Entry Buttons</font></h1>
These buttons will allow you to move between records and do any type of
entering or deleting of records.&nbsp; You need to see <a href="setup.en.html">SETUP</a>
because there are parameters there which control how these buttons react
<h1><a name="first"></a>
First</h1>
If you want to go through the list of already entered data, this button
must be the first pressed (alternately you can press FIND described below).&nbsp;
This button will take you to the very first record in the entire database.&nbsp;
If there are no records then after pressing this button you will see a
blank form.
<h1><a name="next"></a>
Next</h1>
This button can only be used after FIRST or FIND.&nbsp; This button will
take you to the next record in the database.&nbsp; If you have gone through
all the records in the database, then pressing this button will show a
blank form.&nbsp; You must then press either FIRST or FIND to go throught
the list again
<h1><a name="find"></a>
Find</h1>
This will produce a dialog box which will allow you to search after specific
records in the database.&nbsp; See the <a href="find.en.html">FIND </a>section
.&nbsp; After pressing this button then you need to press NEXT to get the
next record in the list
<h1><a name="clear"></a>
Clear</h1>
This button will simply clear the form.&nbsp; You might need to do this
to make it easier to enter new data into the form but this button is not
normally necessary to use.
<h1><a name="add"></a>
Add</h1>
After you have entered new data, then you must press this button to enter
the data into the database permanently.
<h1><a name="change"></a>
Change</h1>
After you have used the FIRST, FIND, NEXT buttons to show a specific record,
you can then make changes in the record and press this button to enter
the changes in the record.
<h1><a name="delete"></a>
Delete</h1>
After you have used the FIRST, FIND, NEXT buttons to show a specific record,
you can use this button to delete the record you see.&nbsp; Deleteing records
can have severe consequences.&nbsp; A record may be linked to other records
and deleting the record will permanently break the link thus ruining the
records it was linked to .
<h1><a name="exit"></a>
Exit</h1>
This will exit this form
<h1><a name="help"></a>
Help</h1>
This will take you to the appropriate help information
