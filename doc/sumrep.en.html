<h1>
<font size=+4>Special report</font></h1>
This report will allow you to make reports very similar to what is requried
for all kinds of Tax returns and what ever government forms you could find.
It is based on the idea that you will have several different groups of
accounts that will be summarized individually and then later summarized
as a whole (or perhaps partially in yet again sub groups.).
<h1>
Account display and grouping</h1>
This group is where you enter the first level of summarizing of accounts.&nbsp;
And, if wanted, you can show accounts without gouping them together with
other accounts.
<h3>
Account from</h3>
Here you choose the first level account you want to show on your report.&nbsp;
You may enter the same account many times in this column if it is needed
in your report.  This is the beginning (inclusive) account number.  If you want to specify only one
account then "Account from" will be equal to "Account to".
<h3>
Account to</h3>
Here you choose the first level account you want to show on your report.&nbsp;
You may enter the same account many times in this column if it is needed
in your report. This is the end (inclusive) account number.  If you want to specify only one
account then "Account from" will be equal to "Account to".
<h3>
Commentary</h3>
This is a line of commentary that will appear on the report beside this
given groups total.&nbsp; Note that for several accounts in the same group,
only the commentary from the first account in the group will be used.&nbsp;
The others will be ignored.
<h3>
Minus</h3>
If this account is to be subtracted from the total then mark this box
<h3>
First level group</h3>
Here is where you specify which accounts will be summarized together by
simply giving any code you like in this column.&nbsp; The code must be
the same for all the accounts which will be summarized together in that
group.&nbsp; If this column is blank, then this account will not be in
any group and it will be shown on its own in the report.&nbsp; Note that
all members of a group must be together consecutively in this list, otherwise
the results will be very strange.
<h3><a name="AddRow"></a>
Account display and grouping - Add row</h3>
If you need another empty row to enter an account in, mark the row that
you want the empty line to appear at and press this button.&nbsp; If no
line is marked, a new row will appear at the bottom.
<h3><a name="DeleteRow"></a>
Account display and grouping - Delete row</h3>
Mark the row with the cursor that you want to delete and then press this
button.
<h1>
Second level group</h1>
In this area is where you enter the information about which groups you
made in the previously mentioned Account display and grouping will be yet
again grouped together to form a secondary summary.
<h3>
First level group</h3>
Here you will be allowed to enter group codes that you have previously
entered in the previously mentioned First level group.&nbsp; But, each
group may only be allowed to be entered just once and as you enter groups
in this column, you will notice that your choices of possible groups will
diminish automatically from the drop down list boxes.
<h3>
Commentary</h3>
This is a line of commentary that will appear on the report beside this
given groups total.&nbsp; Note that for several first level groups&nbsp;
in the same second level group, only the commentary from the first first
level group will be used.&nbsp; The others will be ignored.
<h3>
Incomming</h3>
If you need an extra column for the sum of transactions before the given
dates, then this column should be marked.  This is useful only for accounts
that are Assets.
<h3>
Minus</h3>
If this group is to be subtracted from the second level total then mark
this box.
<h3>
Second level group</h3>
Here is where you specify which first level groups will be summarized together
by simply giving any code you like in this column.&nbsp; The code must
be the same for all the first level groups which will be summarized together
in that second level group.&nbsp; If this column is blank, then this group
will not be in any second level group and it will be shown on its own in
the report.
<h3><a name="AddRowSecondary"></a>
Second level group - Add row</h3>
If you need another empty row to enter an group in, mark the row that you
want the empty line to appear at and press this button.&nbsp; If no line
is marked, a new row will appear at the bottom.
<h3><a name="DeleteRowSecondary"></a>
Second level group - Delete row</h3>
Mark the row with the cursor that you want to delete and then press this
button.
<h1><a name="company"></a>
Company</h1>
This report will only do one company at a time.&nbsp; So, you must choose
the company to printout on here.&nbsp; If you have only one company and
have choosen to not be able to change the company (see Options-><a href="setup.en.html">SETUP</a>)
then this will be disabled and you dont need to do anything here.
<h1><a name="period"></a>
Period</h1>
The period is two dates that are the suggested start and end dates for this report.
 You may however, overide these dates by changing the two fields below.
<h1><a name="StartDate"></a>
Start date</h1>
This report will print all transaction in the accounts between the given start
and stop date where the start and stop date will be applied to the Invoice

There must exist records bettween these two dates, otherwise there will
be no report.
<h1><a name="StopDate"></a>
Stop date</h1>
This report will print all transaction in the accounts between the given start
and stop date where the start and stop date will be applied to the Invoice
date field you entered in DataEntry-><a href="transaction.en.html">Transaction</a>.&nbsp;
There must exist records bettween these two dates, otherwise there will
be no report.
