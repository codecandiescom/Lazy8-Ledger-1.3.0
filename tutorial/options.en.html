<H2>Lesson: The options screen </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To come to the options screen, you must choose the menu Utilities->options
<br><br>
<IMG src="images/options.en.gif">
<br><br>
Here is where you do all the major setup of the system.  In the column on the left you
must select the different rows in order to see all these options.

<p></p>
<h1>General
</h1>
<h2><a name="menulevel"></a>Menu difficulty level</h2>
<p>
Choose what sort of user you are?  This information is used to decide how 
much to change the jEdit environment.  If you choose 'Accounting only' then
 the jEdit environment will be changed to only allow accounting.  It is very 
 important that you choose this if you only want to do accounting and you are 
 not a programmer.  If you choose 'Programmer accountant' then the jEdit 
 environment will be changed to enhance accounting, but you may still use 
 jEdit for programming.  If you choose 'Programmer', then the JEdit environment 
 will not be changed at all.
</p>
<h2><a name="Languages"></a>
Default language</h2>
Hit this button to change what language you want to be shown in all the windows.&nbsp; You
must shut down this program before any changes will take place.
<h2><a name="WordProcesser"></a>
External word processor</h2>
The word processor internal to this program is very limited yet used constantly.
You may choose
here to use your own word processor instead of the internal word processor.
Simply write in the full path of your word processing program or use the
BROWSE button to find the program.  Your personal word processor must
be able to use Rich Text Format (RTF), most do anyway. The
following are examples of programs and paths to well known word processors

<h1>Number formats
</h1>

<h2>
<a name="ReportNumberFormats"></a>
Report Number Formats</h2>

<h2><a name="ReportLeftJustify"></a>
Report Left justify</h2>
Left justify the numbers in a field or column

<h2><a name="ReportRightJustify"></a>
Report Right justify</h2>
Right justify the numbers in a field or column

<h2><a name="ReportStandard"></a>
Report - OS System standard number</h2>
This format is very good however, it lacks control over the decimal point.
That is, if you have decimals, then the decimal points will not line up.  If you have decimals
then better alternative is to choose one of the special formats to get a good line
up of the decimal points.
<h2><a name="ReportCurrency"></a>
Report - OS System standard currency</h2>
This is what either your operating system has predefined for you as the 
standard currency format or what the java system has decided is the 
default for your operating systems defined country and language.  This format
always has excellent control over the decimal points.  However, this 
number format always includes the currency sign with each number.  This
is usually too much so this format is not very interesting. 
<h2><a name="ReportSpecialButton"></a>
Report - Special format</h2>
If you select this special format, then you must give what format you
want in the following text box
<h2><a name="ReportPatterns"></a>
Report - Special format text entry</h2>
It is highly suggested that you choose one of the predefined formats 
because this formatting is very specific and easy to do wrong. 
However, if you want more information on how to 
make your own formats, see <a href="../doc/numberformats.en.html">number formats.</a>


<h2>
<a name="InputNumberFormats"></a>
Input Number Formats</h2>

<h2><a name="InputLeftJustify"></a>
Input - Left justify</h2>
Left justify the numbers in a field or column

<h2><a name="InputRightJustify"></a>
Input - Right justify</h2>
Right justify the numbers in a field or column

<h2><a name="InputStandard"></a>
Input - OS System standard number</h2>
This format is very good however, it lacks control over the decimal point.
That is, if you have decimals, then the decimal points will not line up.  This
is normally not a problem for number inputting.  So if you can stand that the 
decimal points dont line up then I highly suggest this format.  Otherwise,
then better alternative is to choose one of the special formats to get a good line
up of the decimal points.
<h2><a name="InputSpecialButton"></a>
Input - Special format</h2>
If you select this special format, then you must give what format you
want in the following text box
<h2><a name="InputPatterns"></a>
Input - Special format text entry</h2>
It is highly suggested that you choose one of the predefined formats 
because this formatting is very specific and easy to do wrong. Even
some of the predefined formats will stop you from inputing numbers.  For
instance, dont use any formats that require a currency sign.
However, if you want more information on how to 
make your own formats, see <a href="../doc/numberformats.en.html">number formats.</a>

<h1><a name="warnings">
Warnings</h1>

<h2><a name="Allow-changes-to-transactions"></a>Allow changes to transactions</h2>
This may not be changed after the first time you start this program.
Do you want to be able to change transactions entered into the database?  
The laws in most countries do not allow changes for proffesional accounting.  
The lawful solution is to enter another transaction to correct the wrong 
transaction.  However, such strict rules are unnecessary for a non-proffesional 
use of this program.   If you are not sure, I suggest you choose to allow 
changes to the database.
<h2><a name="Require-password-at-start"></a>Require password at start</h2>
This may not be changed after the first time you start this program.
If this is selected then each time you start this program 
you will be required to put in a username and a password.  Then, if you forget the password, you 
will not be able to see your data.
<h2><a name="Confirm-after-a-record-is-added"></a>Confirm after a record is added</h2>
You will get a message after each record is added.  This so you can be sure your record
was entered into the database.
<h2><a name="Confirm-before-deleting-a-record"></a>Confirm before deleting a record</h2>
You will get a question 'Are you sure you want to delete.....' each time you try to delete
a record. 
<h2><a name="Tab-stop-on-customer-during-input"></a>Tab stop on customer during input</h2>
In the transaction data input window, there is a customer field that the cursor will stop
at each time you fill in a record.  This is unnecessary for most people however, if you 
are required to enter a customer for each transaction then this should be selected.
<h2><a name="Confirm-after-deleting-a-record"></a>Confirm after deleting a record</h2>
You will get a message after each record is deleted.  This so you can be sure your record
was deleted from the database.
<h2><a name="Clear-screen-after-adding-a-record"></a>Clear screen after adding a record</h2>
This is normally the best way to work.  If you often enter records that are very nearly 
identical, then perhaps you want to unselect this so that with minimal changes you can 
reenter the record as a new record.
<h2><a name="Clear-screen-after-deleting-a-record"></a>Clear screen after deleting a record</h2>
This is normally the best way to work.  However, if you want to see the record you have
just deleted, then unselect this option.  
<h2><a name="Show-context-help"></a>Show context help</h2>
You should have this selected in the beginning so that you can get help for every field your
mouse passes over.  The help will show up in a 'InfoViewer' on the right hand side of your
screen.  After you have learned this program, you dont need this anymore and can unselect it.
<h2><a name="Warn-to-backup-data-if-changes-made"></a>Warn to backup data if changes made</h2>
This will warn you every time you exit this program that you should do a backup of your database.
See <A HREF="backup.sv.html">Database Backups and restoring</A> for more information.
<h2><a name="Require-encrypted-backup-files"></a>Require encrypted backup files</h2>
If this is selected then your database backups will be encrypted.  That means you will need
to enter a password each time you do a backup and that password must be used again each time
you restore the database.  This is for those whose work requires secrecy or confidentiality
and this is especially useful if you will be transfering your backup over the internet.  For
an explanation on what type of encryption is used, see below:
<br><br>
PBEWithMD5AndDES: The password-based encryption algorithm as defined in: 
RSA Laboratories, "PKCS #5: Password-Based Encryption Standard," version 1.5, Nov 1993. 
Note that this algorithm implies CBC as the cipher mode and PKCS5Padding as the 
padding scheme and cannot be used with any other cipher modes or padding schemes. 

<h2><a name="Allow-company-changes-in-all-windows"></a>Allow company changes in all windows</h2>
If this box is checked then all windows which have a company selection
box will not be disabled.  Otherwise all other occurances of the company
in other windows will be disabled and only the Default company chosen when
you started this program will be allowed.


<h2><a name="OK">
OK button</h2>
Hit this button to accept all the changes you have made.
<h2><a name="apply">
Apply</h2>
The same thing as OK except the screen does not disappear.
<h2><a name="Cancel">
Cancel button</h2>
Hit this button to cancel all the changes you made.
